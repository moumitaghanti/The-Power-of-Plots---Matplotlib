# The Power of Plots

## Background

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to some real-world situations. For this assignment, you'll need to complete **1 of 2** Data Challenges. As always, it's your choice which you complete. _Perhaps_, choose the one most relevant to your future career.

## Pyber

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition,  the following three pie charts are produced:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

reference on expected format.

## Pymaceuticals Inc

While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've since joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As their Chief Data Analyst, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To meet the objective here are the following plots to analyze the data:

* A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Ascatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
* Scatter plots include [error bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar). This will allow the company to account for variability between mice. You may want to look into [`pandas.DataFrame.sem`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sem.html) for ideas on how to calculate this.
